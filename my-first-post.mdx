Greetings, fellow code enthusiasts! üöÄ Today marks a monumental moment for me - my dive into the vast sea of online writing. After the unexpected success of my topic on Testing vs. Debugging which I posted on reddit, I decided to make a blog for myself where I can dump my computer science thoughts and ideas. And what better way to kick things off than sharing some pearls of wisdom about a topic close to my coding heart ‚Äì System Design.

## The Symphony of Design: An Iterative Overture

Let's be real - there's no such thing as a perfect design. It's a journey, not a destination. Like a dance, you twirl with ideas until they fit together like a charm.

## CRC: A Love Triangle of Classes, Responsibilities, and Collaborators

Imagine your code as a lively party with classes playing their roles, taking on responsibilities, and collaborating like old friends. That's Class-Responsibility-Collaborators (CRC) ‚Äì your secret sauce for strong design.

## The Noun-Verb Approach: A Language of Classes

In the grand novel of software, classes are our protagonists. Use the Noun-Verb approach ‚Äì it's like giving each character a role (verb). Identify the nouns, add verbs, and there you have it ‚Äì your cast for a code adventure.

## Responsibilities: The GPS for Your Code‚Äôs Journey

Every class needs a purpose, a reason for being there. Define their responsibilities ‚Äì the guiding stars that keep your code on track.

## Class Interaction: A Social Network for Objects

Think of your classes like guests at a lively party. Identify which classes mingle together. This is where the magic happens ‚Äì connections that make your software not just work but work wonderfully.

## SOLID Principles: The Rockstars of Design

Now, it's showtime! Introduce the rockstars ‚Äì SOLID principles. Keep refining until your code not only works but works in style.

## Parting Words

In the grand symphony of system design, every note matters. So, fellow coders, embrace the iterative dance, let CRC be your love guide, and may your designs be SOLID as a rock concert.

This, my friends, is my humble introduction to the blogosphere. I promise to keep things light, simple, and a bit magical.

Until next time, happy coding! üñ•Ô∏èüíª
